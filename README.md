# What is this???
Simple example of a square plane that you can move around in SFML.
WASD to move and ←↑→↓ and PgUp/PgDown too look around.

**WARNING :** this is not nescessearily how you should do anything in SFML, it is
a simple example for my own refrence pleasure. Tons of dead code and first drafts.
